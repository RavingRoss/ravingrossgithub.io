# Here are some of my research projects from GitHub:

### [Periscope](https://github.com/RavingRoss/Outreach-Periscope)
I 3D printed and build a Periscope which attached to the end of a 1-meter telescope. This was done at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, where I did my undergrad. I loved this project, as it allowed thousands of people to view the solar system and its beauty from an observatory. 

### [ALMA](https://github.com/RavingRoss/ALMA)
A project I worked on in my undergrad which was studying the effects of Fiber LASERs on water ice and regolith. The purpose was to hopefully make an apparatus that could mine water ice on asteroids and the moon. I want to rekindle this project very, very badly!

### [EasyControls](https://github.com/danielwilczak101/EasyControls)
This was a project I worked on for the entirety of my undergrad. I, and my lab mates, 3D printed a CubeSAT which was able to stabalize itself using solenoids, soft tubing, and compressed air. The idea was to make a system which students and researchers alike could use to learn and conduct research, without having to launch a system to space. We build the payload and everything, it was a very in-depth project and was very enjoyable!

## [Variable WD Observations](https://github.com/RavingRoss/EP425_Project)
This was my senior observation project, observing the pulsations of a variable, He White Dwarf. I enojoyed it a lot as I did, and do, research on roAp stars and other types of pulsators. So it was very interesting! I used the SARA observatories alongside the 1-meter telescope on the ERAU campus.
