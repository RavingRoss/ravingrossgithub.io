Here are some of my selected coding and research projects on GitHub:

### [waveform-predictor](https://github.com/yourusername/waveform-predictor)
A neural network that predicts waveform shapes from physical parameters. Trained using TensorFlow and converted to HLS using hls4ml.

### [muon-decay-tdc](https://github.com/yourusername/muon-decay-tdc)
A multi-tap delay line time-to-digital converter (TDC) implemented in Verilog for measuring muon decay events.

### [lightkurve-analysis](https://github.com/yourusername/lightkurve-analysis)
Jupyter notebooks and code for analyzing light curves and periodograms using NASA's Lightkurve package.
