# Welcome to My Official Site!

Hi, I’m **Jacob R. Romeo** — a Physics and Astronomy PhD student at University of Hawaii! I’m currently focused on:

- Pulsation classification of stars
- Signal processing in photodetectors
- String theory (hypothesis)
- Of course... Black Holes

This site serves as a central hub for my [current research](/research/), [publications](/publications/), and [projects](/projects/).

Feel free to browse around or [contact me](/contact/) if you’re interested in collaborating!
