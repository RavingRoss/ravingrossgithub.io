<p>Below is what I am currently researching at UHM.</p>

<h2 id="pulsation-classification"><a href="https://github.com/RavingRoss/pulsation-classification">Pulsation Classification</a></h2>
<p>This is a project I started for one of my classes, but am wanting to publish. I am currently still collecting my findings and parsing through the data!</p>
<h2 id="varner-lab-at-uhm"><a href="https://github.com/RavingRoss/Varner-Lab">Varner lab at UHM</a></h2>
<p>I am currently working on upgrading one of the boardstack systems in the lab. Replacing the SiPMT’s with SiPM’s, as SiPM’s are much, much cheaper and do not break as easy.</p>
