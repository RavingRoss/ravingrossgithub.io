# Below is what I am currently researching at UHM.


## [Pulsation Classification](https://github.com/RavingRoss/pulsation-classification)
This is a project I started for one of my classes, but am wanting to publish. I am currently still collecting my findings and parsing through the data!
## [Varner lab at UHM](https://github.com/RavingRoss/Varner-Lab)
I am currently working on upgrading one of the boardstack systems in the lab. Replacing the SiPMT's with SiPM's, as SiPM's are much, much cheaper and do not break as easy.
