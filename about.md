I am Jacob R. Romeo, a PhD student in Astrophysics at University of Hawaii at Manoa. My research focuses on Stellar variability, CP-Violations, and Lepton ID transitions.
I love to surf, hike, code, and play magic the gathering. I hope to one day make a difference in the astroseismology community and help bring forth and new frontier in Astrophysics!
